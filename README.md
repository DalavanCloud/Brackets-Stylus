#Stylus Support for Brackets

Currently there is no [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) support in [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/).  The first version of this extension just uses the css mode which works reasonably well.

To install this extension download the zip an put the contents in the `src/extensions/dev` directory.
